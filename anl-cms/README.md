## 🔄 Data Migration to Strapi Cloud

To migrate data from local development to Strapi Cloud:

1. **Export local data** (with Strapi running):
   ```bash
   node export-data.js
   ```

2. **Get API token** from Strapi Cloud admin (Settings > API Tokens)

3. **Update import script** with your cloud URL and API token in `import-data.js`

4. **Import data** to cloud:
   ```bash
   node import-data.js
   ```

**Note:** If using the CLI transfer command, ensure schemas match:
```bash
yarn strapi transfer --to https://your-cloud-project.strapiapp.com/admin --to-token YOUR_TRANSFER_TOKEN --force
```

**Important:** Create admin user first and ensure cloud database schema matches local (richtext fields should be TEXT, not VARCHAR).
