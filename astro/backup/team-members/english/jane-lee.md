With over three decades of professional experience, she has proven capabilities in project management, data governance, information security, compliance, and Agile program leadership. Her career reflects a consistent track record of strengthening organisational controls, ensuring regulatory compliance, and leading large-scale initiatives that balance business priorities with risk management.

Over 23 years at Citi, she held progressive leadership roles spanning compliance and global identity administration. As a Compliance Business Control Analyst for more than seven years, she was part of the team that set up the ASPAC Cross Border Data Clearance unit, supporting the end-to-end implementation of its automation tool and collaborating with global stakeholders to meet data privacy, bank secrecy, and outsourcing requirements. Prior to that, she served over 15 years as an Application SME in Global ID Administration, where she led a regional team, ensured audit and regulatory readiness, and played a key role in ISO 9001 certification activities while implementing measures to strengthen information security and access governance.

Earlier in her career, she contributed nearly eight years at the Asia Pacific Banking Institute, the training arm of Citi, where she managed and delivered large-scale programs, laying the foundation for her continued work in program management, governance, and training.
