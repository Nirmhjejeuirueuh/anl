Bridging Strategy, Technology, and People - Across the Banking and Education Sectors
Timothy has over 20 years of global IT leadership experience across banking, and education sectors. He has led large-scale digital transformation programs, built resilient infrastructure across Asia-Pacific, and managed complex IT service delivery. Today, he oversees the end-to-end ICT asset lifecycle across hundreds of sites, driving automation, compliance and data-driven insights powered by Al.

Beyond technology, Timothy is recognised for cultivating high-performing teams, integrating cybersecurity into business strategy, and advancing innovation. His mission has consistently been to bridge business priorities with IT service delivery, ensuring resilience and efficiency in highly regulated environments. He has advanced from technical management to strategic leadership, while remaining committed to mentoring and cross-functional collaboration.

Rooted in strong values and inspired by John C. Maxwell's leadership philosophy, Timothy brings a human-centred approach to strategy and change. Having lived, studied, and worked across major Asia-Pacific hubs - Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia - he combines global expertise with local insight. He is well positioned to advise organisations on digital transformation, cybersecurity resilience, cloud strategy, and IT/business alignment - bringing both operational depth and personal integrity to every engagement.
